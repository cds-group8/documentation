# Collaborative Data Science

> The goal of the study is to understand how data scientists remotely collaborate and communicate using Jupyter Notebook and common collaboration tools. You will join us with 4 remote sessions during this week to work on a predictive modeling problem in groups of 2. The winner will receive up to $50 gift card for each team member. Good luck!

## Group8 Timeline

- Session 1: December 1, 3:00pm - 4:00pm, CET (9:00am - 10:00am, EST)
- Session 2: December 1, 4:00pm - 5:00pm, CET (10:00am - 11:00am, EST) 
- Session 3: December 2, 3:00pm - 4:00pm, CET (9:00am - 10:00am, EST)

## Task Description
The problem description will be posted [here](overview.md) when the study starts. You should submit the following materials at the end of the study:
- A final report in Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
- Prediction result on the test dataset

We are using a remote screensharing tool to collect data. You should walkthrough [session 0](session0.md) before the study to install the required tools.

## Tools for Collaboration
Please use [Experimentor](https://experimentor-test.mentoracademy.org) for collaboratively editing Jupyter Notebooks. A detailed instruction could be find [here](howto.md). Feel free to use other tools for collaboration.
